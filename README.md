# Decision Tree Tool üå≥
*Like a family tree, but for your problems (and way more useful)*

**Warning: May cause sudden clarity and organized thinking**

**Side effects include: knowing what to do next, systematic decision-making, and looking like you actually have your life together**

Turn your "I have no idea what to do" moments into structured decision-making with visual trees that map out your options. Because sometimes you need to see all your choices laid out before you can pick the least terrible one.

## What it does ‚úÖ
- Maps complex decisions into clear, branching paths
- Helps you visualize consequences and outcomes
- Turns overwhelming choices into manageable steps
- **Works with ANY project** (no hardcoded paths - we're not monsters)
- **Integrates with Claude workflows** for systematic analysis
- **Generates professional decision trees** for systematic documentation
- Makes you look like you actually have your life together

## What it doesn't do ‚ùå
- Make decisions for you (that's still your job, sorry)
- Guarantee good outcomes (we're tools, not fortune tellers)
- Fix your commitment issues (therapy not included)
- Judge your life choices (we're supportive like that)

## üöÄ **NEW: Smart Project-Based Activation**

**Project detection from command names!** Each project gets its own trees, prompts, and insights:

```bash
# Activate any project - creates structure automatically
./activate_OpsBrain      # Start/resume OpsBrain project
./activate_MyProject     # Creates & activates new project
./activate_DataAnalysis  # Each project is independent

# End session and prepare tomorrow
./bye_OpsBrain          # Saves work, creates tomorrow's prompt
./bye_MyProject         # Project-specific closure

# View all projects
./projects              # Shows all projects and their status
```

### Quick Setup for New Projects
```bash
# Just create a symlink and go!
ln -s activate activate_YourProject
./activate_YourProject  # Auto-creates everything
```

## üìù **Command Reference**

### Primary Commands (in /Volumes/workplace/)
| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `activate_<Project>` | Start/resume project session | `./activate_OpsBrain` |
| `bye_<Project>` | End session, create tomorrow's prompt | `./bye_OpsBrain` |
| `projects` | List all projects and status | `./projects` |

### Master Control Script
```bash
/Volumes/workplace/DecisionTreeTool/claude.sh [command] [project]
```
- `start [project]` - Start a Claude session
- `stop [project]` - End current session
- `status` - Show session status
- `list` - List projects and files
- `archive` - Archive old files
- `clean` - Clean temporary files

## üß† **Claude Workflow Integration**

Perfect for systematic analysis and professional decision documentation:

### **Professional Decision Tree Format**
```markdown
### **Node 56: Database Performance Analysis**
**Timestamp**: 2025-09-12 18:42
**Situation**: Query response time degraded by 300%
**Decision Point**: What's the root cause?

#### Options Evaluated:
1. ‚úÖ **Check Connection Pool**
   - Pros: Quick to verify, common issue
   - Cons: Might not be the root cause
   - Feasibility: High

2. ‚ùå **Rebuild Indexes**
   - Pros: Would improve performance
   - Cons: Takes 4 hours, affects production
   - Feasibility: Low

**Rationale**: Connection pool exhaustion is most likely cause
**Action Taken**: Increased pool size from 10 to 50 connections
**Result**: Response time improved by 250%
**Next Node**: 57 - Monitor for 24 hours
```

### **Activation Script Integration**
Your activation scripts work perfectly with the tool's markdown export format. The tool generates decision trees that match your systematic approach and can be integrated with any project workflow.

```

### 3. Professional Workflow Integration

```bash
# Create a professional-style decision tree
python manage_decision_tree.py create --name "rca_database_slowdown" --description "Root cause analysis for database performance issues"

# Perfect for your Claude activation script workflow!
```

### 6. How to Write Good Questions and Actions (Professional Style)

**For Questions (decision points):**
- Keep them systematic: "Is the issue customer-facing?" not "Are customers maybe affected?"
- Make them measurable: "Is CPU usage > 90%?" not "Is CPU high?"
- Be specific: "Can you ping the database server?" instead of "Is network working?"
- Follow professional format: Clear, actionable, measurable

**For Actions (what to do):**
- Start with a verb: "Check logs", "Restart service", "Escalate to team"
- Include the actual command: `--action "sudo systemctl restart nginx"`
- Be clear about the outcome: "Page on-call team and create incident channel"
- Document the result: "Monitor for 24 hours and document findings"

**Example professional-style prompts:**

```bash
# Good systematic questions
python manage_decision_tree.py add --question "Is the issue affecting > 50% of users?"
python manage_decision_tree.py add --question "Is the error rate > 5% in the last 10 minutes?"
python manage_decision_tree.py add --question "Can the database accept new connections?"

# Good action steps with clear outcomes
python manage_decision_tree.py add --question "Restart web server cluster" --type action --action "Rolling restart of all web servers with health checks"
python manage_decision_tree.py add --question "Escalate to database team" --type action --action "Page database on-call with current metrics and error logs"
python manage_decision_tree.py add --question "Enable detailed monitoring" --type action --action "Activate debug logging and increase metric collection frequency"

# Good systematic answer labels
python manage_decision_tree.py link --parent node1 --child node2 --answer "yes"
python manage_decision_tree.py link --parent node1 --child node3 --answer "no"
python manage_decision_tree.py link --parent node2 --child node4 --answer "critical"
python manage_decision_tree.py link --parent node2 --child node5 --answer "non-critical"
```

### Python API Usage

```python
from DecisionTreeTool.decision_tree_tool import DecisionTree, DecisionTreeCLI

# Create a decision tree with project context
cli = DecisionTreeCLI()
cli.set_project("myproject")

# Create and build your tree
tree_id = cli.create_tree("systematic_analysis", "Professional systematic analysis")
cli.add_node_cmd("Is the issue customer-facing?")
cli.add_node_cmd("Escalate immediately", "action", "Page on-call and create incident")

# Export to your project directory
result = cli.export_tree("markdown", project_name="myproject")
print(result)  # Shows where the file was saved
```

### Creating Decision Trees in YAML (Professional Style)

```yaml
name: incident_response_systematic
description: Professional systematic incident response workflow
metadata:
  version: "1.0"
  author: "Your Team"
  node_counter: 56  # Continue from your current node

nodes:
  start:
    question: "Is the issue customer-facing?"
    children:
      yes: "assess_severity"
      no: "internal_monitoring"
    confidence: 0.95

  assess_severity:
    question: "What is the customer impact level?"
    children:
      critical: "immediate_escalation"
      high: "standard_escalation"
      medium: "scheduled_response"
      low: "monitor_and_document"
    weight: 2.0  # High importance

  immediate_escalation:
    action: "Page on-call engineer, create incident channel, notify leadership"
    confidence_adjustment: 0.1  # High confidence in this path
```

### MCP Server Usage (Claude Integration)

```bash
# Start the MCP server for Claude integration
python -m DecisionTreeTool.decision_tree_mcp

# The server exposes tools for:
# - Loading decision trees from your projects
# - Executing decisions with context
# - Getting professional-style recommendations
# - Tracking decision history for systematic analysis
```

### Advanced Project Management

```python
# Set up multiple projects
cli = DecisionTreeCLI()

# Configure your main project
cli.set_project_path("myproject", "/path/to/your/main/project")

# Configure other projects
cli.set_project_path("development", "/path/to/dev/projects")
cli.set_project_path("incidents", "/path/to/incident/trees")

# Switch between projects seamlessly
cli.set_project("myproject")
cli.export_tree("markdown")  # Goes to main project directory

cli.set_project("development")
cli.export_tree("json")  # Goes to development directory

# Load trees from any project
cli.load_tree("rca_analysis", "myproject")  # Load from main project
cli.load_tree("debug_workflow", "development")  # Load from dev
```
