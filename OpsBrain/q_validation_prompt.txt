Q, please run these validation checks to verify our logic:

1. **Package Journey Test**:
   - Traces 5 actual RUSH packages through the network
   - Shows every scan and location
   - Proves if V→D flow is real

2. **Transfer Rate Check**:
   - What % of V-station packages go to D-stations?
   - If low %, our assumption is wrong

3. **True Dwell Times**:
   - Measures actual first scan → delivery time
   - Shows if 30-minute SLA is realistic
   - Gives real compliance rate

4. **Status Transition Logic**:
   - Shows common status sequences
   - Validates our container model
   - Identifies skipped statuses

Run the query in: /Volumes/workplace/DecisionTreeTool/OpsBrain/validate_package_flow.sql

This will tell us:
- Is V→D flow real or assumed?
- What's the actual end-to-end time?
- Are we measuring the right things?
- Does our container model match reality?
