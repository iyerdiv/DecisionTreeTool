Q, please run this FIXED query that properly handles package state transitions:

The key fixes:
1. Uses FIRST occurrence of each status (packages can have multiple scans)
2. Handles packages that skip STOWED state (go direct to departure)
3. Calculates true dwell from first AT_STATION to first departure event
4. Properly counts DISTINCT packages in each container at each interval

Please execute the query in: /Volumes/workplace/DecisionTreeTool/OpsBrain/fixed_5min_container_analysis.sql

This will show:
- 5-minute interval populations for Container 1 (inducted but not stowed) and Container 2 (stowed but not departed)
- Bottleneck identification when containers exceed thresholds
- Summary statistics including SLA compliance (% meeting 30-minute target)

The logic now correctly tracks:
- Packages that skip states
- Multiple scans of same status
- True end-to-end dwell times
- Distinct package counts (no duplicates)
