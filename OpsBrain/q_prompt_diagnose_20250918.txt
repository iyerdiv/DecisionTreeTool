Q, we have a data mismatch issue. Please run the diagnostic queries to find out what's actually in Heisenberg.

## File to Run:
/Volumes/workplace/DecisionTreeTool/OpsBrain/diagnose_data_issues_20250918.sql

## What We're Checking:

1. **Mercury Packages**: Do those 5 tracking IDs exist at all?
2. **SWA Stations**: What stations have "SWA" in their name?
3. **Top Stations**: Which stations have the most RUSH packages Sept 15-17?
4. **Date Range**: What dates actually have data?
5. **Tracking ID Format**: What prefixes are actually used?
6. **High Dwell Stations**: Which stations have packages >200 min dwell?

## This Will Help Us:
- Understand why Mercury packages aren't found
- Identify the correct station codes
- Verify date ranges match
- Find where the high-dwell bottlenecks actually are

## Command:
```bash
cd /Volumes/workplace/DecisionTreeTool/OpsBrain
PGPASSWORD='2w|:k0]!bY9&r~#T(yhn5=;$6D%;j*9yEO[z2}U[kCve8~F}2NTQV.b$ViZs4X.`' \
psql -h superlab-na.db.amazon.com -p 8199 -d superlab -U iyerdiv \
  -f diagnose_data_issues_20250918.sql \
  -o diagnosis_results_20250918.txt
```

This will reveal what data we actually have access to!
