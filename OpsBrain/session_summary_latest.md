# OpsBrain Session Summary - Latest

## Session Outcome
Successfully pivoted from trying to match Mercury's specific tracking IDs to validating the RCA approach using Little's Law and sensitivity analysis on real operational data.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Data Discovery
- **Found**: DCM3 station with 4.4M RUSH events on Dec 17, 2024
- **Table**: `heisenbergrefinedobjects.d_perfectmile_shipment_status_history`
- **Query that found it**: Station exploration query checking for RUSH volume

### 2. Conceptual Breakthroughs
- **Station Types**: S = Sub Same Day (not Sort Center)
- **SWA1**: Is an SSD FC at 607 Riverside Rd, Everett, WA
- **M1-M4**: Are project modules, not container states
- **Pivot**: Validate approach, not specific data points

### 3. RCA Framework Development
Created comprehensive SQL queries for:
- Little's Law validation (L = Î»W)
- Sensitivity analysis (arrival rate, missing DEA, time of day)
- Bottleneck detection (WHERE and WHEN)
- Alert threshold calibration

## Next Session Tasks
1. Identify 30 stations with sufficient RUSH package volume
2. Run Little's Law baseline calculations
3. Measure sensitivity to arrival rate changes
4. Test breaking points for each station
5. Rank stations by stability/sensitivity
6. Validate findings against actual incidents

## Critical Insights
- Mercury data (Sept 2025) appears to be test/training data
- Heisenberg has real operational data (Dec 2024/Jan 2025)
- DCM3 on Dec 17, 2024 is our validation baseline
- Sensitivity analysis is key to predicting system instability
- Little's Law holds until system reaches breaking point

## Session Status
**Completed**: Framework development and data discovery
**Ready**: To execute 30-station sensitivity analysis
**Confidence**: HIGH - have approach, data, and validation method
