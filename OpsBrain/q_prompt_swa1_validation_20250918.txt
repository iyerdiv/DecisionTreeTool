Q, please run this SWA1 validation query to match our analysis against Mercury's ground truth data.

## Context:
Mercury shows 90,955 defects at SWA1 with specific packages having extreme dwell times (267-2497 minutes). We need to validate that our analysis can identify the same bottlenecks.

## Query Location:
/Volumes/workplace/DecisionTreeTool/OpsBrain/swa1_validation_query.sql

## What This Query Does:

1. **Validation Against Mercury** (Section 1-3):
   - Takes 5 specific packages Mercury flagged (2269, 267, 289, 2497, 266 min dwell)
   - Calculates dwell using our method
   - Compares to see if we match Mercury's numbers

2. **Find All High-Dwell Packages** (Section 4):
   - Searches SWA1 for ALL packages with >200 min dwell
   - Shows how many match our 267-307 minute target range
   - Identifies Missing DEA pattern

3. **Little's Law Application** (Section 5):
   - Calculates Î» (arrival rate), L (inventory), W (wait time)
   - Identifies peak bottleneck hours
   - Shows which hours have worst congestion

## Expected Results:
- Should find ~90K defects if we match Mercury
- Specific packages should have dwell within 10% of Mercury
- Should identify 2-4pm bottleneck pattern
- Missing DEA should be primary issue

## How to Run:
```bash
cd /Volumes/workplace/DecisionTreeTool/OpsBrain
PGPASSWORD='2w|:k0]!bY9&r~#T(yhn5=;$6D%;j*9yEO[z2}U[kCve8~F}2NTQV.b$ViZs4X.`' \
psql -h superlab-na.db.amazon.com -p 8199 -d superlab -U iyerdiv \
  -f swa1_validation_query.sql \
  -o swa1_validation_results.txt
```

## Key Validation Points:
1. Do our dwell calculations match Mercury's?
2. Can we find the same high-dwell packages?
3. Does Little's Law identify the bottleneck times?
4. Is Missing DEA the root cause?

This validation proves our analysis framework can detect the same operational issues that Mercury's defect system identifies, giving confidence in our approach for other stations.
