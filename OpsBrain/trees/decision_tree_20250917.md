## Session Work: SQL Query Development - 2025-09-17 15:03

### Task: Mercury SSD Data Extraction with 5-Minute Intervals

#### Key Activities:
1. **Located existing SQL queries** for container level analysis
   - Found: instation_container_levels_v3.sql (excludes same-day)
   - Created: instation_container_levels_v3_ssd_20250917.sql (INCLUDES same-day)

2. **Modified query for SSD analysis:**
   - Removed %SAME% exclusion to include same-day packages
   - Set to 5-minute intervals (critical for SSD dwell analysis)
   - Test period: July 18-19, 2025 (2 days)
   - Station: DAE1

3. **Prepared execution scripts:**
   - Created RUN_5MIN_QUERY.sh with Redshift credentials
   - Parameters: 5-minute intervals, DAE1 station, 2-day test

4. **Database connection:**
   - Server: superlab-na.db.amazon.com:8199
   - Database: superlab
   - New password received and configured
   - Requires VPN connection

#### Container Logic:
- **Container 1**: Packages inducted but not yet stowed (dwell at induction)
- **Container 2**: Packages stowed but not yet departed/delivered (dwell in staging)
- 5-minute granularity essential for capturing rapid SSD transitions

#### Status: 
- Query prepared, awaiting execution with VPN connected
- Expected output: ~576 rows (2 days Ã— 24 hours Ã— 12 intervals/hour)

#### Next Steps:
- Execute query with VPN connected
- Verify 5-minute interval data
- Expand to full 32-day period if test succeeds

## SSD Analysis Deep Dive - 2025-09-17 19:30-20:00

### CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Wrong Ship Method Filter
**Problem**: Query searched for `ship_method LIKE '%SAME%'` but SSD packages use RUSH methods
**Solution**: Updated to search for RUSH methods per Amazon documentation

#### Correct SSD Ship Methods Identified:
- **AMZL_US_RUSH_SD** (current standard)
- **AMZL_US_RUSH** (legacy)
- **AMZL_US_SP_RUSH** (special rush)
- **AMZL_US_RUSH_DIRECT_SD** (direct delivery)
- **AMTRAN_RUSH/RUSH2/RUSH3** (middle mile)

### Key Findings:
1. **Initial Query Results**: Only 2 packages with 267-307 minute dwell times
2. **Dwell Time Crisis**: These times are 10x the acceptable 30-minute threshold
3. **Root Cause**: Wrong filter - should search RUSH not SAME

### Files Created:
- `ssd_analysis_WORKING_BASED.sql` - Corrected query using proven v3 structure
- `run_ssd_working.sh` - Execution script for corrected query
- Multiple failed L6 attempts cleaned up

### Multi-Station Analysis Initiated:
- DAE1: Original station showing bottleneck
- DLA9: High-volume comparison
- DJC2: Additional comparison
- Determining if issue is isolated or systemic

### Business Impact:
- **SLA Target**: <30 minutes dwell
- **Actual**: 267-307 minutes (4.5-5 hours)
- **Severity**: Critical operational failure

### Next Steps:
- Run corrected query across multiple stations
- Compare dwell times to identify outliers
- Prepare findings for Xiaoyu meeting
- Update Figma with discovered bottlenecks

## Session End: 2025-09-17 20:15:00

### Final Status:
- Built POC container analysis query
- Discovered only 60 SSD packages at DAE1
- Identified schema issues (heisenbergrefinedobjects vs hb_na)
- Ready for M4 framework presentation

### Tomorrow's Focus:
- Present container model as scalable framework
- Position DAE1 as proof of concept
- Emphasize network-wide applicability

## Session End: 2025-09-18 08:13:26

### Final Status:
- Reviewed sprint progress and meeting notes
- Prepared M4 updates for team
- Identified next steps: Execute queries, complete sensitivity analysis
- Ready for EWA1 site visit Friday

## Session Resumed: 2025-09-18 (Continued from 9/17 session by mistake)
### Note: User logged into same Claude session instead of starting fresh

### Session Work: 2025-09-18 Morning
- Analyzed Q's query results showing data issues (future dates, wrong station prefixes)
- Discovered V-stations are SSD hubs, D-stations are delivery (Vâ†’D network flow)
- Applied Little's Law to identify bottlenecks at V-stations during 3pm peaks
- Created validation queries and fixed 5-minute interval analysis
- Reviewed sprint goals and prepared RCA focus
- Processed morning meeting transcript from PerfectSensei OpsBrain Sprint Review
- Updated M4 work summary for team presentation

### Key Discoveries Today:
- V-prefix stations (VNY5, VOR3) are SSD fulfillment hubs with high RUSH volume
- D-prefix stations receive from V-stations (not direct SSD processing)
- Sept 2024 data available (not 2025 as initially tried)
- Shift from generation-based to retrieval-based RCA methodology needed

## Session End: 2025-09-18 08:15:00

### Final Status:
- Decision tree updated to reflect continued session
- Ready for sensitivity analysis work
- EWA1 site visit scheduled for Friday
- Need to execute queries for actual package data

---
## Session End: 2025-09-18 10:17:45

### Final Status:
- Completed SWA1 validation query with 5-minute intervals
- Renamed all files with 20250918 date labels
- Ready to validate against Mercury's 90K defects
- Next: Execute queries and compare results with Mercury data

### Key Deliverables:
- SWA1 validation query with 5-min Little's Law analysis
- Mercury package tracking comparison
- M4 updates prepared for team presentation

### Tomorrow's Focus:
- Execute validation queries
- Complete sensitivity analysis
- Prepare for Friday EWA1 site visit
