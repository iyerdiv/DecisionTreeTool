Q, let's validate our bottleneck detection with a two-step approach.

## File to Run:
/Volumes/workplace/DecisionTreeTool/OpsBrain/validate_bottleneck_approach.sql

## Step 1: Find the Problem Station
Run the first query to identify which station has the most bottlenecks. This will show:
- Stations with most high-dwell packages (>180 min)
- Days with issues
- Missing DEA percentages
- Most recent problematic date

## Step 2: Deep Dive That Station
Once we get the results from Step 1:
1. Take the top station code (e.g., "DXX1" or "CAX2")
2. Take the most recent date with issues
3. Uncomment the 5-minute analysis query
4. Replace 'XXX' with the station code
5. Replace 'YYYY-MM-DD' with the date
6. Run the 5-minute analysis

## Validation Points:
- **Bottleneck Detection**: arrivals > exits * 1.5 = BOTTLENECK
- **Little's Law**: W = L/Î» (wait time = inventory/arrival rate)
- **Peak Hours**: Should show congestion 12-8 PM
- **Missing DEA**: Higher during bottleneck periods

## Command for Step 1:
```bash
cd /Volumes/workplace/DecisionTreeTool/OpsBrain
PGPASSWORD='2w|:k0]!bY9&r~#T(yhn5=;$6D%;j*9yEO[z2}U[kCve8~F}2NTQV.b$ViZs4X.`' \
psql -h superlab-na.db.amazon.com -p 8199 -d superlab -U iyerdiv \
  -f validate_bottleneck_approach.sql \
  -o validation_step1_results.txt
```

This approach doesn't depend on specific tracking IDs - it finds real bottlenecks!
