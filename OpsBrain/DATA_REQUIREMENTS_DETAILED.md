# What I Mean by "Better Data"

## 🔴 Current Data Problems

### 1. We Have AGGREGATED Data
```
Current EVENT1 data:
- num_inflow_event1: 15, 4, 15, ...  (already summed)
- num_outflow_event2: 0, 0, 0, ...    (already summed)
- num_remain_event1: 15, 4, 15, ...   (already averaged)
```

**Problem:** These are PRE-AGGREGATED counts, not raw events. We can't see:
- Individual package movements
- Exact timing of events
- Which packages are in which state

### 2. Ambiguous Column Meanings
```
num_remain_event1: What IS this?
- Total packages in facility?
- Average in a zone?
- Sample count?
- Batch size?

We assumed it's queue depth, but 70 packages average seems too low
for a facility processing 6,820/hour
```

### 3. Time Granularity Issues
```
Current: Hourly buckets
Problem: Can't see dynamics within the hour
- Are arrivals spread evenly?
- Do they come in bursts?
- When do bottlenecks actually occur?
```

### 4. Missing Critical Information
```
What we DON'T have:
- WHERE packages are (which zone/stage)
- WHO is processing them (staff levels)
- WHAT type of packages (size, priority)
- WHY they're delayed (specific bottleneck)
```

## ✅ What "Better Data" Would Look Like

### 1. EVENT-LEVEL DATA
```csv
timestamp,package_id,event_type,location,worker_id
2025-09-12 07:40:04.123,TBA324323741539,arrival,receiving_dock,NULL
2025-09-12 07:40:45.456,TBA324323741539,scan,inbound_scan,W123
2025-09-12 07:42:12.789,TBA324323741539,move,sorting_area,W123
2025-09-12 07:55:23.012,TBA324323741539,sort,chute_15,W456
2025-09-12 08:15:34.345,TBA324323741539,stage,outbound_dock_3,W789
2025-09-12 08:45:45.678,TBA324323741539,depart,delivery_truck,NULL
```

**Why this is better:**
- Can track INDIVIDUAL packages
- See EXACT timestamps (not hourly buckets)
- Know WHERE packages are
- Can identify SPECIFIC bottlenecks

### 2. STATE SNAPSHOTS
```csv
timestamp,location,packages_count,workers_count,capacity
2025-09-12 07:40:00,receiving,45,3,100
2025-09-12 07:40:00,sorting,234,8,500
2025-09-12 07:40:00,staging,89,4,200
2025-09-12 07:40:00,loading,156,5,300
```

**Why this is better:**
- Direct measurement of queue depths
- Can see capacity utilization
- Identify resource constraints
- No ambiguity about what's being measured

### 3. FLOW DATA
```csv
timestamp,from_location,to_location,package_count,duration_sec
2025-09-12 07:40:00,receiving,sorting,25,180
2025-09-12 07:40:00,sorting,staging,18,240
2025-09-12 07:40:00,staging,loading,22,120
```

**Why this is better:**
- Can verify conservation laws
- See actual transfer rates
- Identify slow transitions
- Build accurate flow networks

### 4. CLEAR DEFINITIONS
```yaml
data_dictionary:
  queue_depth:
    definition: "Total packages physically present in location"
    measurement: "Direct count from sensors"
    update_frequency: "Every 60 seconds"

  dwell_time:
    definition: "Time from facility entry to exit"
    measurement: "Last_scan_time - first_scan_time"
    units: "seconds"

  num_remain:
    definition: "Packages not yet processed at end of period"
    measurement: "Closing inventory count"
    scope: "Entire facility"
```

## 📊 Specific Data Needed for Physics Models

### For Conservation Laws:
```
NEED: Complete flow accounting
- Every package entry (with timestamp)
- Every package exit (with timestamp)
- Periodic inventory counts
- No missing flows

TEST: Sum(In) - Sum(Out) = Change in Inventory
```

### For Little's Law:
```
NEED: Three independent measurements
- L: Actual count of packages in system
- λ: Arrival rate (packages/time)
- W: Actual time in system (from entry to exit)

TEST: L should equal λ × W (within measurement error)
```

### For Queue Theory:
```
NEED: Service time distributions
- Time to process each package
- Inter-arrival times
- Service capacity (max rate)
- Number of servers/workers

TEST: Compare actual queue with M/M/c predictions
```

### For Chaos Detection:
```
NEED: High-frequency measurements
- At least every 5 minutes
- Same measurement point
- Long time series (>1000 points)
- No aggregation

TEST: Calculate Lyapunov exponents properly
```

## 🎯 Minimum Viable "Better Data"

If we can't get everything, here's the minimum:

### Option 1: Event Log
```csv
package_id,entry_time,exit_time,path
TBA123,2025-09-12 07:40:04,2025-09-12 13:45:23,"receive->sort->stage->load"
```

### Option 2: Zone Counts
```csv
timestamp,zone,actual_count,arrivals,departures
2025-09-12 07:00:00,sorting,234,145,132
```

### Option 3: Clarified Current Data
```
Just tell us EXACTLY what these mean:
- num_remain_event1: _______________
- timestamp_dwell_min: _____________
- Is this sampled or census data?
- What's the measurement methodology?
```

## ❌ Why Current Data Fails Physics Models

1. **Conservation fails** → Missing flows or wrong measurements
2. **Little's Law fails** → Queue depth measurement is wrong
3. **Statistics fail** → Aggregation hides true distributions
4. **Predictions fail** → Can't see actual dynamics

**Bottom line:** We're trying to understand a complex system through a tiny, foggy window. We need a clear, complete view.

## 📋 Data Quality Checklist

Good data should be:
- [ ] **Complete** - No missing records
- [ ] **Consistent** - Same units, same definitions
- [ ] **Granular** - Event-level, not aggregated
- [ ] **Documented** - Clear definitions
- [ ] **Timely** - Frequent enough to see dynamics
- [ ] **Accurate** - Measured, not estimated
- [ ] **Traceable** - Can follow individual items

Current EVENT1 data scores: **2/7** ❌
