# OpsBrain Session Prompt - September 19, 2025

## Context from Previous Sessions (Sept 17-18)

### Current Status:
Working on **M4 (Missing Context)** root cause analysis for SSD delivery delays. Focus shifted to **SWA1 station validation** against Mercury's 90,955 defect reports showing packages with 267-2497 minute dwell times.

### Key Discoveries (Updated Sept 18):
1. **Mercury Ground Truth**: SWA1 has 90K+ defects with extreme dwell times (some >40 hours)
2. **Validation Target**: 5 specific packages to compare (TBA324382452417: 2269 min, etc.)
3. **5-Minute Intervals**: Critical for SSD analysis (30-min target needs 5-min granularity)
4. **Data Dates**: Using Sept 12-17, 2025 data (current year confirmed)
5. **Station Focus**: SWA1 replaces earlier V-station analysis

### NEW: SWA1 Analysis Files (Sept 18):
- `/Users/iyerdiv/swa1_validation_corrected.sql` - Main validation query with 5-min Little's Law
- `swa1_validation_final_20250918.sql` - Final version
- `swa1_bottleneck_analysis_20250918.sh` - Execution script
- `mercury_tracking_ids_20250918.txt` - Problem packages from Mercury

## Tomorrow's Priority Tasks:

### 1. Execute SWA1 Validation Query
```bash
PGPASSWORD='2w|:k0]!bY9&r~#T(yhn5=;$6D%;j*9yEO[z2}U[kCve8~F}2NTQV.b$ViZs4X.`' \
psql -h superlab-na.db.amazon.com -p 8199 -d superlab -U iyerdiv \
  -f /Users/iyerdiv/swa1_validation_corrected.sql \
  -o swa1_5min_results_20250919.txt
```

### 2. Compare Results with Mercury
- Mercury shows: 2269, 267, 289, 2497, 266 minute dwell times
- Our query should match within 10%
- Check if Missing DEA is the pattern

### 3. Complete Sensitivity Analysis
- Use validated SWA1 data as baseline
- Show how Î» (arrival rate) changes impact W (wait time)
- Identify threshold where system breaks

### 4. Prepare for Friday EWA1 Site Visit
- Bring SWA1 findings as comparison
- Prepare questions about bottleneck observations
- Document what to look for at stations

### 5. Key Metrics to Report
- What % of SWA1 packages exceed 30-min SSD target?
- How many match the 267-307 minute range?
- Which 5-minute intervals show worst bottlenecks?
- Is Missing DEA the root cause?

## Files to Use:
- Main query: `/Users/iyerdiv/swa1_validation_corrected.sql`
- Mercury packages: `mercury_tracking_ids_20250918.txt`
- UAT plan: `uat_validation_plan_20250918.md`

## Expected Outcomes:
1. Validation that our analysis matches Mercury's defect detection
2. Proof that 5-minute intervals catch bottlenecks hourly data misses
3. Evidence for Missing DEA as primary root cause
4. Little's Law quantification of bottleneck severity

## Meeting Prep:
- Have concrete tracking IDs with journey traces
- Show 5-minute bottleneck progression
- Compare SWA1 findings to Mercury's 90K defects
- Demonstrate shift to retrieval-based RCA

## Remember:
- Database might timeout - may need multiple attempts
- SWA1 is the validation station (not V-stations anymore)
- 5-minute intervals are essential (not hourly)
- Focus on Sept 15-16, 2025 for peak data

## Start With:
```bash
activate_OpsBrain
# Run the SWA1 validation query
# Compare with Mercury's numbers
# Begin sensitivity analysis if match is good
```

Good luck with the validation!
