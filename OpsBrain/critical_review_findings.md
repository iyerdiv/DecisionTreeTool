# Critical Review of Sensitivity Analysis

## üö® Issues Identified

### 1. **Data Time Period Mismatch**
- **CSV Data**: July-August 2025 (FUTURE dates!)
- **Our Mission**: Validate using December 2024 data
- **Problem**: We're analyzing future/simulated data, not the real DCM3 December 2024 data we intended

### 2. **Negative Sensitivity Coefficients**
Several stations show **negative** sensitivity (-0.57 to 4.28):
- DYO5: -0.54
- DOR3: -0.50
- DXT8: -0.22
- DDP9: -0.39

**Critical Thinking**: Negative sensitivity means queue DECREASES when arrivals INCREASE. This is physically impossible unless:
- Data quality issues
- Calculation error
- Time lag effects not accounted for

### 3. **Wait Time Anomalies**
Look at these wait times (hours):
- DBC3: 956.49 hours (40 days!)
- DBO9: 1207.09 hours (50 days!)
- DYN7: 693.03 hours (29 days!)

**Reality Check**: Packages can't wait 40-50 days in a same-day delivery station. This indicates:
- Unit mismatch (maybe minutes, not hours?)
- Division by near-zero arrival rates
- Data collection errors

### 4. **Universal Sorting Bottleneck**
ALL 30 stations show "SORTING" as primary bottleneck.
**Statistical Impossibility**: In real operations, we'd expect:
- Some loading bottlenecks (morning rush)
- Some dispatch bottlenecks (evening delivery)
- Variation across different station designs

This suggests:
- Algorithm bias in bottleneck detection
- Systematic data collection issue at sorting stage
- Possible formula error in wait time calculations

### 5. **Correlation Paradox**
- Arrivals vs Queue: 0.22 (weak positive)
- Arrivals vs Wait: -0.09 (NEGATIVE!)

**Little's Law says**: More arrivals ‚Üí longer queues ‚Üí longer waits
**Our data says**: More arrivals ‚Üí shorter waits (impossible!)

### 6. **Stability Classification Logic Flaw**
NO stations classified as "STABLE" despite:
- Some having low CV (0.639 for DLX5)
- Some having low sensitivity (0.11 for DFM4)

Our thresholds may be too strict or miscalibrated.

### 7. **Peak Ratio Concerns**
DWA5 shows 2.89x peak ratio but only 8.3% anomaly rate.
If peak is really 3x normal, we'd expect more anomalies.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis of Issues

### Data Quality Problems:
1. **Future dates** (2025) suggest this is simulated/test data
2. **Missing arrivals**: Many hours show 0 arrivals but positive throughput
3. **Unit confusion**: Wait times in wrong units
4. **Missing data**: Gaps filled with 0s instead of NULLs

### Calculation Errors:
1. **Little's Law application**: Should be W = L/Œª where Œª is departure rate, not arrival rate
2. **Sensitivity calculation**: Not accounting for time delays between stages
3. **Bottleneck identification**: Comparing incomparable units (different stages have different scales)

## ‚úÖ What We Got Right

1. **Framework is sound**: Little's Law + Sensitivity approach is valid
2. **Metrics make sense**: CV, sensitivity coefficient, peak ratios are right metrics
3. **SQL structure**: Well-organized CTEs and calculations
4. **Python implementation**: Clean, modular code

## üîß Corrections Needed

### 1. Use Correct Data
```python
# Should query Heisenberg for DCM3 December 2024
# Not use this future-dated CSV file
```

### 2. Fix Wait Time Calculation
```python
# Current (wrong):
wait_time = queue_length / arrivals

# Correct:
wait_time_minutes = queue_length / max(throughput, 1)  # Avoid div by 0
wait_time_hours = wait_time_minutes / 60
```

### 3. Fix Sensitivity Calculation
```python
# Account for time lag
lag_periods = 1  # Packages take time to move through system
sensitivity = correlation(queue[t], arrivals[t-lag_periods])
```

### 4. Validate Against Physics
```python
# Add sanity checks
assert all(wait_times < 24), "Wait times exceed 24 hours - check units"
assert all(sensitivities >= 0), "Negative sensitivity is impossible"
```

## üìä Revised Interpretation

Given these issues, the analysis actually shows:

1. **Data Quality**: We're analyzing simulated/test data, not real operations
2. **Method Validation**: Our approach is correct but needs real data
3. **Next Steps**:
   - Query actual Heisenberg data for December 2024
   - Fix calculation bugs
   - Re-run analysis with corrected formulas
   - Validate results against operational reality

## üéØ Key Takeaway

The analysis FRAMEWORK is solid, but we analyzed the WRONG DATA with some CALCULATION ERRORS. We need to:

1. Get real DCM3 December 2024 data from Heisenberg
2. Fix wait time units (likely minutes, not hours)
3. Fix sensitivity to handle time-lagged effects
4. Add reality checks to catch impossible values

**Bottom Line**: Good approach, wrong data, fixable bugs. The mission to validate RCA using Little's Law remains valid, but we need to execute it on the actual operational data we identified earlier.
